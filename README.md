# snake-game

**Overview**
This is a classic Snake game implemented in Python using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface. The objective of the game is to control a snake to eat food items, which makes the snake grow longer. The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the boundaries of the game window.

**Features**
1. Simple and intuitive controls using arrow keys.
2. Real-time score display.
3. Randomly appearing food items.
4. Game over detection when the snake collides with itself or the boundaries.

**Requirements**
Python 3.x
Tkinter (usually included with Python)

**How to Run**
Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your machine.
Save the provided main.py script to your local machine.
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where main.py is saved.
Run the script using the command:
python main.py

The game window will open, and you can start playing by using the arrow keys.

**Game Controls**
Left Arrow Key: Move the snake left.
Right Arrow Key: Move the snake right.
Up Arrow Key: Move the snake up.
Down Arrow Key: Move the snake down.

**How to Play**

Use the arrow keys to navigate the snake towards the food.
Each time the snake eats the food, it grows longer, and your score increases.
Avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body to prevent the game from ending.
The game continues until a collision occurs, at which point "Game Over" is displayed.
